# Etch-A-Sketch

Welcome to the Etch-A-Sketch project! This is a fun and interactive web application that allows users to create drawings on a grid by hovering over the squares. Inspired by the classic toy, this project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Dynamic Grid Creation**: Users can specify the grid size, and the application will generate a new grid accordingly.
- **Color Change**: Each square changes color when hovered over, allowing for colorful and creative designs.
- **Reset Functionality**: Clear the grid and start anew with a fresh canvas.

## Usage

1. Enter the desired grid size (up to 100).
2. Click the "Generate Grid" button to create the grid.
3. Hover over the squares to draw.
4. Click "Reset" to clear the grid.

## Things That Need to Be Fixed

- **Responsiveness**: Improve the layout for smaller screens to ensure a better user experience on mobile devices.
- **Color Customization**: Allow users to choose their own colors instead of the default hover effect.
- **Random Colors**: Ability to see random colors for each square on the grid instead of the default hover effect.
